# IDU

IDU, or Italy Down Under is a progressive web app(PWA) written in gatsby.js using a sanity as a headless CMS. The client's business is selling tours and information about italy, in terms of history, architecture, food, culture etc. This repo is not the completed version, as of course I don't own the rights to the completed PWA
